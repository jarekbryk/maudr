### What is this?

This is a work in progress on a package-to-be to generate simulated data and model answers for enzyme kinetics. 
The main purpose behind this package is to use the data and model answers in undergraduate biochemistry teaching.

### useR! participants?

If you're coming here after my talk at useR, I uploaded my presentation here as well as a zip file of a project 
with the full script and example data that I used in the gif demo, so that you can reproduce the whole script right now, 
without waiting for us to finish the package ;-).

This is another test.
