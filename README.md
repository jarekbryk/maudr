# maudr

## Introduction

**maudr** is an R package designed to simulate, distribute, and evaluate enzyme kinetics data for teaching and assessment in biochemistry and related laboratory courses. It allows instructors to automatically generate individualized, realistic experimental datasets for each student (complete with enzyme inhibition conditions) and to produce corresponding answers with visual summaries. 

The name of the package is a play on the name of [Dr Maud Menten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maud_Menten), a Canadian biochemist who established fundamental principles of enzyme kinetics, along with Dr Leonor Michaelis.

### Example use case

A typical use scenario of the package is for instructors to produce individual datasets for students that contain absorbance values for an inhibited and non-inhibited reaction of alcohol dehydrogenase over a range of substrate concentrations and with different inhibitors. 

The input file for reaction parameters can be modified to accommodate other enzymes and inhibitors. The individual datasets generated by the package also include a small amount of user-controllable random variation in absorbance values, to simulate experimental variation.

The data can then be analysed by students to produce visualisations of enzyme reaction rates (as absorbance vs time, dependant on substrate concentrations), to plot Michaelis-Menten curves to estimate Km values and to identify the type of inhibition using the Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plot.

Because individual datasets analysed by students would then require individual solutions to be calculated and ploted by instructors, the package also produces the plots and estimated Km values from individual students' datasets and comparisons of inhibited and non-inhibited conditions.

Originally, the set of scripts that became the maudr package was developed during COVID-19 lockdowns, where students could not attend laboratory classes but we still wanted them to practice topics in enzyme kinetics. Since then, we have used these functions to produce datasets for formative exercise for students, either in preparation for the laboratory classes, or during revision sessions.

One of us (JB) presented the idea for the package in 2024 on the useR! conference in Salzburg; slides (static only) from [the presentation are included with the package](man/figures/jarekbryk_useR_maudr_talk_2024-07-09.pdf) and available on [useR! pages](https://userconf2024.sched.com/event/1c8vr/datasets-and-assignments-for-undergraduate-teaching-enzyme-kinetics-as-an-example-jarek-bryk-university-of-huddersfield).

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

**maudr** is only available on GitHub, there are no plans to upload it to CRAN.

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jarekbryk/maudr")
```

## üìà Usage

### Introduction

The package uses enzyme kinetic parameters for _S. cerevisiae_ alcohol dehydrogenase, as established in a [1987 publication by Ganzhorn _et al._](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)61419-X/pdf). An Excel file with the parameters for ADH and its inhibitors is provided by default (`reaction_parameters.xlsx`), however, parameters for other enzymes and inhibitors can be provided by the user, as long as the column names remain unchanged (Fig. 1.):

- `rxn_substrate`
- `Kcat`
- `Km`
- `Vmax`
- `enzyme_conc`
- `inhibition_actual`

![Fig. 1.: Reaction parameters table (this is the default ADH table included with the package; it is also used in demo mode).<br/><br/>](man/figures/example_reaction_parameters_file.png)


If the default parameters are used, the only input file required for the package is an Excel file with a list of students for whom the datasets will be generated and analysed. This file must have one row per student, with the following column headers (Fig. 2.):

- `student_no` ‚Äì unique student ID (e.g. "u123456")
- `first_name` ‚Äì student's first name
- `surname` ‚Äì student's surname

![Fig. 2.: Example student list (this list is included for the demo mode).<br/><br/>](man/figures/example_student_list_file.png)


### Process

The package has four main functions to produce students' datasets and analysis of their results; the functions should be used in order.

#### `initialiseProject()`

Sets up a top-level folder (default location: current folder) where the input data will be stored and output produced. The top-level folder will be named "maudr_assignments" unless a different name is specified by the user. Folders `data` and `output` are created, with subfolders `output/assignments_output` and `output/answers_output`. RStudio project structure is not used.

#### `assignReactions()`

Takes a list of students and a table with enzyme parameters and creates a metadata table with an assignment of every student-to-reaction conditions, randomly drawn from the `reaction_parameters.xlsx file`. This table is deposited in the `output/assignments_output` folder in the top-level project folder created by `initialiseProject()`.

If neither of the input files are provided, this function runs in a demo mode, using a provided list of four imaginary students and enzyme parameters for the ADH to proceed.

The output of `assignReactions()` is a list with a timestamp and the metadata table with student-reaction assignments. The timestamp is used as an input for the next function and serves as a unique identifier for each run of the package.

#### `generateAssignments()`

Takes the timestamp as input (and, invisibly, the student-reaction assignments table) and produces Excel file for each student with absorbances for the reactions with their assigned substrate and inhibitor. The files are deposited in the  `output/assignments_output` folder with a given timestamp.

![Fig. 3.: Example student assignment file.<br/><br/>](man/figures/example_student_assignment_file.png)


#### `generateAnswers()`

Takes the timestamp as input (and, invisibly, all the student-specific files) and produces PDF file with the results of the analysis of students' data. The results include plots of:

- absorbance vs time (for inhibited and non-inhibited reactions)
- Michaelis-Menten curves (for inhibited and non-inhibited reactions)
- Lineweaver-Burk (for inhibited and non-inhibited reactions, with regression equations) 

The PDF files can be generated individually for each student as separate files, or all together in a single file, or both. The PDF files are deposited in the `output/assignments_output` folder with a given timestamp.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example use

```r
library(maudr)

initialiseProject(path = "~/Desktop")

setup <- assignReactions(student_file = "~/Documents/students_file.xlsx", project_path = "~/Desktop/maudr_assignments") # students_file.xlsx is copied into the data folder in the top level folder; the default reaction_parameters.xlsx is used.

generateAssignments(run_timestamp = setup$timestamp, project_path = "~/Desktop/maudr_assignments") # Assignments (one Excel file per student) will be deposited in the output/assignment_output folder

generateAnswers(run_timestamp = setup$timestamp, project_path = "~/Desktop/maudr_assignments", output_files = "both") # Assignments (one PDF file per student plus a single PDf with answers with all students' datasets) will be deposited in the output/answers_output folder
```
